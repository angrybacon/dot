This repository contains a number of configurations I find myself copying over
and over from one machine to another during installations.

* Arch

See [[ARCH.org]].

* MacOS

Increase the key repeat rate beyond the naive limit that is enforced by macOS.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1
#+END_SRC

Install core dependencies, somehow not present by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install coreutils most
#+END_SRC

* Windows

Soon :tm:
