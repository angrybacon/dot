This repository contains a number of configuration I find myself copying over
and over from one machine to another during installations.

Below are some OS-specific extra configurations.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Eventually, this will be laid out in a single Org file that tangles things
automatically.
#+END_QUOTE

* Arch

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ln -fs ~/Workspace/dot/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -fs ~/Workspace/dot/gitignore ~/.gitignore
#+END_SRC

* MacOS

Increase the key repeat rate beyond the naive limit that is enforced by macOS.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1
brew install coreutils most
#+END_SRC

* Windows

Soon :tm:
