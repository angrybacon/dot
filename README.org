This repository contains a number of configurations I find myself copying over
and over from one machine to another during installations.

* Linux

See [[./LINUX.org][LINUX.org]].

* MacOS

** Bootstrap

Increase the key repeat rate beyond the naive limit that is enforced by macOS.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1
#+END_SRC

Install core dependencies, somehow not present by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install coreutils
#+END_SRC

This also prefixes GNU utilities with =g=. In order to use their real name, add
the following to your =PATH= variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC diff
+PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
#+END_SRC

** iTerm Themes

Retrieve the theme files here: https://iterm2colorschemes.com/ and import them
directly in iTerm.
