This repository contains a number of configuration I find myself copying over
and over from one machine to another during installations.

Eventually, this will be laid out in a way that allows symlinking to the files
directly.

* MacOS

Increase the key repeat rate beyond the naive limit that is enforced by macOS.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1
brew install coreutils most
#+END_SRC

* Windows

Soon :tm:
