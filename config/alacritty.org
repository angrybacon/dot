* Configuration

** Bootstrap

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Import additional configuration files
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
#import:
#  - /path/to/alacritty.yml

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  #TERM: alacritty

** Window Configuration

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml

  #position:
  #  x: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)

  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  #padding:
  #  x: 0
